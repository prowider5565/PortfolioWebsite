Description: My project manages a construction business end-to-end in one system, covering project sites, buildings, apartment sales and contracts, accounting, materials, and workers with role-based access.

It goes beyond CRUD by implementing structured workflows, apartment lifecycle management, contracts and installments, finance and operations (expenses, suppliers, salaries, UZS/USD exchange), analytics with export/PDF reports, and automated Telegram/SMS notifications. The system is production-ready, built with NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, React, Docker, authentication, and RBAC.
